# Section 1 - Design and Development

## Q1 Could you outline what you would consider to be important considerations if you were asked to develop a web application that could be potentially used by thousands of users?

freewriting section: compatibility, backwards compatibility, 

memory: what if they have a lot of tabs open, what if it's a blackberry or a kindle or a Smart TV or a playstation
rendering: viewport size, never assuming that a desktop isn't a touch device, that a handheld device doesn't have a keyboard (or any other HID) attached.
Privacy: are they concerned about cookies? are they using a private/incognito window? How much usefulness can we deliver without the user feeling like they have to give anything away?
Delight: Make it pretty. Would a face help? Would motion or animation in any interactions make intent more clear? Is there some common on-board sensor (like a GPS) that would make the tasks less repetitive and more interactive?
Empty space: check any container or list for clarity while very full or completely empty. check the containers in proximity to each other or even nested within one another. Is it still clear?

## Q2 What techniques do you employ to keep up-to-date with the rapid pace of progress in the field [of] front-end development? How do you choose which technologies are worth taking the time to learn more about?

I got into a habit roughly three years ago of making sure I tried something new every Friday. It might be practical to whatever I'm working on; it might be largely irrelevant. I might have something finished and working in an hour, or I might only get one line written after stumbling through a dozen guides. It's about checking with my gut how a particular tool will benefit me and keeping the sample rate regular and short. Wins that come to mind are Meteor, Noodl, Vue, Babel, Emmet, Github Pages. It's rare that I get star-struck by a tool that is still rapidly changing or is hard to learn the basics of in a day. It has happened though with GraphQL for its easy concept and difficult implementation, but it solves a much larger pain point so it's worth the trouble.

# Section 2 - & Deployment

## Q1 Describe the approach you take in testing your applications

My most faithful tests are with real people in a quick usability interview. Test frameworks are great and I'm learning more about how to write tests myself (as apposed to letting it always be delegated to someone else). Travis and Jenkins leveraging those tests to ensure that nothing breaks a production build is nothing short of genius and gives me so much more assurance... but, it's always when I sit down with an average customer that it's most apparent and obvious what needs to be changed and WHY because test frameworks don't tell me how a user FEELS.

## Q2 What do you value in a code base?

transportability: the ability to take a piece out, and examine it in isolation or seamlessly put it into another codebase

respectful of defaults: if there's a common well documented way of implementing something, and this code needs to be different, explain why. This is of particular importance to anyone new who may have only just come from the documentation themselves.

documentation to install, documentation on daily commands, documentation to start over with current settings, documentation to delete completely

# Section 3 - General

## Q1 What do you find most exciting or interesting about working in the software development field?

How it is becoming more human, more "fuzzy". Software is in service of the human idea after all.

## Q2 In your career to date, what are you most proud of and why?

I'm proud of the fact that I've been able to connect with so many real people. When I started out, I was only a kid. It was hard to imagine an internet where everyone wasn't always hidden behind some sort of alias or avatar. I'm proud that I've been with the web's ups and downs ever since, that I never gave up on it. The space shuttle program might've been halted, but we still have The Internet!

So I say Colubia SC is "the armpit of the south"
Garry says "I thought Jacksonville, fl was the armpit of the south. Is that not true? Or.. not true anymore?"
I say "Well we've got two armpits."
