# Section 1 - Design and Development

## Q1 Could you outline what you would consider to be important considerations if you were asked to develop a web application that could be potentially used by thousands of users?

Developing a web application that could potentially be used by thousands of users, I would consider the following X considerations to be priorities:
- Hardware: I never assume that a “desktop computer” isn't a touch device or that a “mobile device” doesn't have an input device attached.
- Memory: Consider that they may have many taps open and the device could be anything from a blackberry to kindle or smart TV or playstation.
- Rendering: viewport size and browser version
- Privacy: are they concerned about cookies? are they using a private/incognito window? How much usefulness can we deliver without the user feeling like they have to give anything away?
- Delight: Make it pretty. Would a face help? Would motion or animation in any interactions make intent more clear? Is there some common on-board sensor (like a GPS) that would make the tasks less repetitive and more interactive?
- Empty space: check any container or list for clarity while very full or completely empty. check the containers in proximity to each other or even nested within one another. Is it still clear?


## Q2 What techniques do you employ to keep up-to-date with the rapid pace of progress in the field [of] front-end development? How do you choose which technologies are worth taking the time to learn more about?

I got into a habit roughly three years ago of making sure I tried something new every Friday. It might be practical to whatever I'm working on; it might be largely irrelevant. I might have something finished and working in an hour, or I might only get one line written after stumbling through a dozen guides. It's about checking with my gut how a particular tool will benefit me and keeping the sample rate regular and short. Wins that come to mind are Meteor, Noodl, Vue, Babel, Emmet, and Github Pages. It's rare that I get star-struck by a tool that is still rapidly changing or is hard to learn the basics of in a day. It has happened though with GraphQL for its easy concept and difficult implementation, but it solves a much larger pain point so it's worth the trouble. CONCLUSION - WHY DID PREVIOUS EXAMPLES = WORTH THE TIME. ALSO, HOW DOES YOUR GUT DECIDE?

# Section 2 - & Deployment

## Q1 Describe the approach you take in testing your applications

Test frameworks ARE CERTAINLY VALUABLE FOR REDUCING ERROR and I'm learning more about how to write tests myself (as opposed to letting it always be delegated to someone else). Travis and Jenkins leveraging tests to ensure that nothing breaks a production build is nothing short of genius and gives me so much more assurance... but, it's always when I sit down with an average customer that it's most apparent and obvious what needs to be changed and WHY because test frameworks don't tell me how a user FEELS. My most faithful tests are with real people in a quick usability interview. 

## Q2 What do you value in a code base?

I VALUE THE FOLLOWING THINGS IN A CODE BASE:

transportability: the ability to take a piece out, and examine it in isolation or seamlessly put it into another codebase

respectful of defaults: if there's a common, well-documented way of implementing something, and this code needs to be different, explain why. This is of particular importance to anyone new who may have only just come from the documentation themselves.

documentation to install, documentation on daily commands, documentation to start over with current settings, documentation to delete completely

# Section 3 - General

## Q1 What do you find most exciting or interesting about working in the software development field?

I AM MOST EXCITED BY THE WAY it is becoming more human, more "fuzzy". Software is in service of the human idea after all.

TELL ME MORE!!!!

## Q2 In your career to date, what are you most proud of and why?

I'm proud of the fact that I've been able to connect with so many real people.
- Usability test with the homeless/vocal/strange customers, most people disregarded feedback 
I'm proud that I've been with the web's ups and downs ever since, that I never gave up on it. 

SELL YOURSELF BETTER! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE LATELY?

- 

I’m really proud of my ability, dedication to W3C process, 

The way finding kiosk is the best thing I’ve ever built. It had a lot of features, and I had even bigger plans for what it would be able to do in the future.
- plotted walls from blueprints to real geolocation coordinates, learning a bunch about different kinds of map projections and formats; finally made use of GeoJSON which was exciting to [track the changes of on github](https://github.com/RCPL/wayfinding/commits/master/static/data/geojson).
- understanding that GPSs in phones would soon  allow for sub-meter accuracy, I knew that defining

-I love how elegantly I could display lots of information by automating how much data displayed at one time

So I say Colubia SC is "the armpit of the south"
Garry says "I thought Jacksonville, fl was the armpit of the south. Is that not true? Or.. not true anymore?"
I say "Well we've got two armpits."
